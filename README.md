# [Repository Name]



Ideally, repository names should use the following format:

 ```[business-unit-name]--[project/product-name]--[application/service-name]--[application/service-type]--[additional-context]```. 

* ```[business-unit-name] ```: business unit (examples software-engineering, bi, rrhh, etc)

* ```` [project/product-name] ````: project name or product name.
* ```` [application/service-name] ````: application name or service name.
* ```` [application/service-type] ````: application type or service type. (api, frontend, microservice, library, etc)
* ```` [additional-context] ````: Additional information of type service and other contexts. This option is optional and complementary, examples (modulex, auth)

Examples:

| [business-unit-name] | [project/product-name] | [application/service-name] | [application/service-type] | [additional-context] | Full Repository Name (lowercase)                       |
