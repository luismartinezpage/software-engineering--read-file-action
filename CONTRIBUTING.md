## Handbook for Contributors and Maintainers

### Maintainers

[Software Engineering Core Team](https://github.com/orgs/Iberia-Ent/teams/swe) is the main author and maintainer of Innersource model for IB. You can start a discussion with them from the [Discussion Panel](https://github.com/orgs/Iberia-Ent/teams/swe).

### Contribution workflow

If you'd like to write some code for innersource, the standard workflow is as follows:

1. Check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the [innersource-template issues](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/innersource-template/issues) to avoid duplicating work
    * If there isn't one already, please create one so that others know you're working on this
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [innersource-template repository](https://github.com/Iberia-Ent/innersource-template) to your GitHub account
3. Make the necessary changes / additions within your forked repository
4. Submit a Pull Request against the `dev` branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged

If you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [docs from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) or even their [excellent `git` resources](https://try.github.io/).
